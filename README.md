FIFO DESIGN AND VERIFICATION USING SYSTEM VERILOG

This project focuses on the design and verification of a Synchronous FIFO module in Verilog, ensuring synchronized data transfer and accurate FIFO behaviour. The system uses SystemVerilog for testbench development and covers various aspects of the design, including write and read operations, pointer management, and a scoreboard for verification.
